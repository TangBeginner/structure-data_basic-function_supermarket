//Case Study
Siti Supermarket is a franchise supermarket located in Malaysia. Although the size of Siti 
Supermarket is small and compact when compared to other supermarkets, it still consists of many types of 
resources that are ready to sell to the customers. For example, groceries, daily supplies and others. After 
customers have chosen the things that they are willing to buy, they will go to the cashier counter to pay 
their bills. A receipt will be given to the customers after the bill has been paid. Elements that will be shown 
in the receipt are the order ID, customer name, amount of the items that has been taken by the customer, 
the total price of the items that has been taken by the customer and the date for that current day. The cashier 
on duty will key in the data of the customer’s order into the computer database. If the cashier accidentally 
enters the wrong information for the customer’s order, the data for the customer’s order will be deleted. 
Besides that, if it is the first time for the customer to purchase items in the supermarket, the customer’s 
order data will be recorded according to the date. If it is not the first time for the customer to purchase items 
in the supermarket, the customer’s order data will also be keyed into the system database but the data will 
be placed behind the previous order data due to the different date.
